title: Near-infrared LIF spectroscopy of HfF
abstract: The molecular ion HfF+ is the chosen species for a JILA experiment to measure the electron electric dipole moment (eEDM). Detailed knowledge of the spectrum of HfF is crucial to prepare HfF+ in a state suitable for performing an eEDM measurement [1]. We investigated the near-infrared electronic spectrum of HfF using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of a supersonic molecular beam. We discovered eight unreported bands, and assign each of them unambiguously, four to vibrational bands belonging to the transition [13.8]0.5 ← X1.5, and four to vibrational bands belonging to the transition [14.2]1.5 ← X1.5. Additionally, we report an improved measurement of vibrational spacing of the ground state, as well as anharmonicity ωexe.
