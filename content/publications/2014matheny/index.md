title: Phase synchronization of two anharmonic nanomechanical oscillators
abstract: We investigate the synchronization of oscillators based on anharmonic nanoelectromechanical resonators. Our experimental implementation allows unprecedented observation and control of parameters governing the dynamics of synchronization. We find close quantitative agreement between experimental data and theory describing reactively coupled Duffing resonators with fully saturated feedback gain. In the synchronized state we demonstrate a significant reduction in the phase noise of the oscillators, which is key for sensor and clock applications. Our work establishes that oscillator networks constructed from nanomechanical resonators form an ideal laboratory to study synchronizationâ€”given their high-quality factors, small footprint, and ease of cointegration with modern electronic signal processing technologies.
